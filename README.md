# Bin-Packing-Optimal-Solution
Most Optimal Solution Algorithm for Bin Packing Problem

NOTE: This algorithm finds the most optimal solution for the Bin Packing Problem. Do not miss this with the most optimal working Greedy Algorithms. Greedy algorithms, Best-fit algorithm for example, may work more optimally but they will not suffice finding the most optimal solution. This algorithm implemented finds the most optimal solution but it will not be sufficient as time complexity since this is an exponential time algorithm. Just a warning.

Since I suffered from finding any implementation of this algorithm on Python, I wanted to implement it by myself. This algorithm basically finds the real optimal solution for the Bin Packing algorithm with the given inputs W (being list of weights) and C (being the capacity value for each bin). One can take it use it however he likes.
